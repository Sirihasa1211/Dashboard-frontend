Hi NAMANI NIVAS,

Thank you for your interest in the role of 'Full Stack Developer Internship'!


Thank you for taking the time to apply for the Full Stack Developer Intern position at Flowbit Private Limited.
We’re happy to share that your profile has been shortlisted for the next round of our selection process.🎉

As the part of the next round please submit the following assignment by

10.11.2025 to recruit@flowbitai.com
🎯Objective
Build a production-grade full-stack web application consisting of two main modules:

Interactive Analytics Dashboard (data-driven, pixel-accurate to the provided Figma design)

“Chat with Data” Interface — powered by self-hosted Vanna AI and Groq/ LLM, enabling natural-language analytics on the same dataset.

This task evaluates:

End-to-end architecture and deployment

Database design and backend APIs

Frontend implementation accuracy (Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)

AI integration and reasoning with real data

Documentation, structure, and overall production quality

🧩Dataset
You are provided with a JSON file:
📁 Analytics_Test_Data.json (attached here) Google Drive link.

This file contains real-world invoice and vendor data.

Your Tasks:
Create a PostgreSQL database.

Ingest the data from Analytics_Test_Data.json into suitable relational tables (e.g., invoices, vendors, line_items, payments, etc.).

Expose backend APIs that serve this data to the dashboard and to Vanna AI.

Ensure referential integrity and clean data modeling (types, primary keys, relationships).

💡 Hint: The JSON contains nested structures such as vendor, customer, payment, and line items — you are expected to normalize these logically into database tables.

💻Tech Requirements
You must use the following stack:

🧱Monorepo
Use Turborepo or npm workspaces for both frontend and backend.

🖥Frontend (apps/web)
Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Language: TypeScript

UI Library: shadcn/ui + TailwindCSS

Charts: Chart.js or Recharts

⚙Backend (apps/api)
Runtime: Node.js (TypeScript)

Framework: Express.js or Next.js API routes

Database: PostgreSQL

ORM: Prisma / Drizzle (your choice)

APIs: REST endpoints as defined below

🤖AI Layer
Self-hosted Vanna AI (Python FastAPI/Flask server)

LLM Provider: Groq/ Or any other

Vanna AI must:

Connect to your PostgreSQL database

Use Groq for SQL generation

Respond to natural-language questions about the data

Return generated SQL and query results

☁Deployment
Frontend + Backend: Host on Vercel

Vanna AI: Self-host (e.g., Render / Railway / Fly.io / local Docker container) or Digital Ocean etc.

Ensure CORS is enabled for your Vercel domain.

🧠Tasks Overview
📊Task 1 — Analytics Dashboard
Recreate the provided Figma dashboard design pixel-perfectly.
Figma Dashboard

Dashboard must include:
Overview Cards

Total Spend (YTD)

Total Invoices Processed

Documents Uploaded

Average Invoice Value
(All values fetched dynamically from backend APIs.)

Charts

Invoice Volume + Value Trend (Line Chart)

Spend by Vendor (Top 10, Horizontal Bar Chart)

Spend by Category (Pie Chart)

Cash Outflow Forecast (Bar Chart)

Invoices Table

Searchable, sortable, scrollable table

Must show vendor, date, invoice number, amount, and status

Backend endpoint: /invoices

💬Task 2 — “Chat With Data” Interface
Add a second tab in the sidebar called “Chat with Data”.

Requirements:
Simple chat UI (prompt + streaming response)

User can ask questions like:

“What’s the total spend in the last 90 days?”

“List top 5 vendors by spend.”

“Show overdue invoices as of today.”

Chat flow:

Frontend sends query to backend endpoint /chat-with-data

Backend proxies request to self-hosted Vanna AI

Vanna AI (with Groq) generates SQL → executes on PostgreSQL → returns structured JSON

Frontend displays:

Generated SQL

Results Table (and optional chart)

🧱Backend API Requirements
Implement the following REST endpoints:

Endpoint	Method	Description
/stats	GET	Returns totals for overview cards
/invoice-trends	GET	Returns monthly invoice count and spend
/vendors/top10	GET	Returns top 10 vendors by spend
/category-spend	GET	Returns spend grouped by category
/cash-outflow	GET	Returns expected cash outflow by date range
/invoices	GET	Returns list of invoices with filters/search
/chat-with-data	POST	Forwards NL queries to Vanna AI and returns SQL + data
⚙Environment Variables (minimum)
 
# Frontend NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=/api NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://<your-app>.vercel.app # Backend DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname VANNA_API_BASE_URL=https://<your-vanna-host> VANNA_API_KEY=<if used> # Vanna AI (Python) DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@host:5432/dbname GROQ_API_KEY=... PORT=8000
📂Deliverables
✅Must Submit:
GitHub Repo (Public or Invite Link)

Structure:

 
/apps /web /api /services /vanna /data Analytics_Test_Data.json
Self-Hosted URLs

Frontend (Vercel): e.g., https://yourapp.vercel.app

Backend API: same base as frontend

Vanna AI (Hosted URL): e.g., https://your-vanna.onrender.com

Database

PostgreSQL instance accessible locally or via Docker Compose (include seed script)

Documentation

Clear setup steps (run commands, env vars)

ER diagram or simple schema overview

API documentation (list routes + example responses)

Explanation of “Chat with Data” workflow (frontend → API → Vanna → SQL → DB → result)

Demo Video (3–5 minutes)

Dashboard loading

Chart and metric updates

Table filters/search

Chat query → SQL → result → chart

✅Acceptance Criteria
Area	Expectation
UI Accuracy	Matches Figma layout closely
Functionality	Charts, metrics, and tables show real data
AI Workflow	Chat queries produce valid SQL + correct results
Database	Proper normalization, constraints, and queries
Deployment	Fully functional, self-hosted setup (Vercel + Vanna)
Code Quality	Typed, clean, modular, and documented
Docs	Step-by-step setup, clear API examples
🎁Bonus & Improvements
💸 Performance Bonus:
Selected candidates with exceptional submissions will receive a monetary bonus in addition to the internship offer.

⚡ Improvement Bonus:
Any enhancements beyond the baseline requirements will be rewarded — for example:

Persistent chat history

CSV / Excel export

Role-based data views

Additional insightful charts

Unit tests or Docker setup

Going beyond the brief to improve usability, performance, or scalability will be considered a strong plus.


All the Best!
